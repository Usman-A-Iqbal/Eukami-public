# Introduction

The purpose of the project was to collaborate in a small agile team to design and develop a web-based e-commerce store based on real client requirements. The project followed the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), starting with requirements gathering through a client interview. This was followed by planning and analysis, where user stories and technical specifications were defined. The design phase included wireframes and UI/UX planning, leading into iterative development using agile sprints. Regular testing, including unit and integration testing, was conducted to ensure functionality and quality. Finally, the project concluded with deployment and a client demonstration, incorporating feedback for refinement.
