## Programming Languages/Tools used

## HTML
Hypertext Markup Language, a system used to design and display websites. Acts as the structure of the web content. HTML was used to create the structure of the EUKAMI website. 
## Tailwind CSS
An open source CSS framework, used to specify the presentation and styling of the document written in markup language such as HTML. This was used to style the HTML code written for EUKAMI.
## React
An open source front end Javascript library, used for creating user interface based on components. React was used to implement interactive effects within the EUKAMI website. 
## Node.js
An open source cross platform runtime environment for implementing javascript code. Node.js was used to run javascript outside the broswer and to operate the backend of the website EUKAMI. 
## Supabase 
An open source PostgreSQL used to create and maintain relational databases. Supabase was used to create the database for the products used on the EUKAMI website.
## Trello
Trello is a collaboration tool used to organise projects on the board. It was used as our primary project management tool and offers a visual overview of our projects through boards, list and cards. 
## WhatsApp

## GoogleMeet
GoogleMeet was used for its screen sharing features and weekly online meetup. Discussion were based on setting goals, discussing challenges and allocating task to each individual team member. 
## Figma
A platform used to implement a visual representation of the EUKAMI website design. This grants team members a mental model on what the website should look like using code. 
## Git & GitHub
Git and GitHub was used to allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase. It also allows developers a space for cooperation and changes to code to be reviewed, discussed, and tested before merging into the main code. 
## Vercel 
A frontend Cloud platform, which maintains the EUKAMI website framework.
